                    1. There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian
                    camels.<br><br>
                    2. Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their
                    eyes.<br><br>
                    3. Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.<br><br>
                    4. Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.<br><br>
                    5. Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot
                    sand.<br><br>

                    1. Chameleons are a very unique branch of the lizard group of reptiles.<br><br>

                    2. There are around 160 species of chameleon.<br><br>

                    3. Chameleons live in warm varied habitats from rainforests through to deserts.<br><br>

                    4. Almost half of the world's chameleon species are native to Madagascar, they are also found
                        in Africa, and southern Europe to as far as Sri Lanka in Asia and have been introduced to 
                        Hawaii, California and Florida.<br><br>

                    5. Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow some chameleon species
                        to change their skin color, creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black,
                        brown, yellow and purple.<br><br>

                1. Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number
                    of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise
                    each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish
                    different humans within a photograph.<br><br>

                2. Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills,
                    such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University
                    found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and
                    motorways, even changing direction at junctions.<br><br>

                3. Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.<br><br>

                4. Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.<br><br>

                5.Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than
                    humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.<br><br>

            <p style="font-style: italic;"><b>
                    1. The origins of Hug A Bear Day are unclear but it may be connected with the day in November
                     1902 when Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear on a hunting trip in Mississippi. <br><br>

                    2. The incident of Roosevelt sparing the bear led to the popularity and naming of Teddy bears. <br><br>

                    3. The story of Goldilocks And The Three Bears was written in 1837 by Robert Southey who was the
                     Poet Laureate at the time. <br><br>

                    4. In Southey’s original story, the visitor to the bears’ house was an ugly old woman. Goldilocks
                     only entered the tale in later versions. <br><br>

                    5. In 1902 in Germany, Steiff launched “Bear 55 PB”, the first toy bear with jointed arms and legs.

                    1. Pandas have been an important and traditional symbol of peace and balance in China 
                    for many years.<br><br>

                    2. Pandas spend 14-16 hours (58%-67%) of each day eating bamboo!<br><br>

                    3. Speaking of bamboo, pandas have six fingers on each paw – including an opposable
                        “thumb” to help them eat bamboo more quickly and efficiently.<br><br>

                    4. A panda cannot hibernate due to the lack of fat reserve from its bamboo diet.<br><br>

                    5. When panda cubs are born, they are so tiny that they are equivalent to 1/900th of
                        their mother’s size!<br><br>

            <p style="font-style: italic;"><b>
                    1. Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a
                        grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.<br><br>

                    2. The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus.
                        (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night,
                        so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.<br><br>

                    3. They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically
                        accurate.<br><br>

                    4. Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on
                        the lookout.<br><br>

                    5. Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for
                        finding a mate or moving to a new location.<br><br>
